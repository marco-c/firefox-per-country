# Firefox issues and suggestions per country

This is the repo where community feedback and suggestions for the adoption and retention of Firefox in specific European countries is gathered and triaged.

If you want more information about this project, please read this blog post: [Firefox Regional feedback: Let's start with Europe](https://release.mozilla.org/firefox/community/2022/11/18/local-feedback-for-firefox)

There is one markdown file per targetted country, currently we have:
* [France](France.md)
* [Germany](Germany.md)
* [Italy](Italy.md)
* [Poland](Poland.md)
* [Spain](Spain.md)

The initial scope of this project is limited to the 5 countries above but feedback for issues in other countries is very welcome. 

If you want to participate to Firefox by helping identifying Firefox issues specific to your location/language and monitoring end-users feedback, don't hesitate to join the [Local Firefox](https://matrix.to/#/#local-firefox:mozilla.org) on [Mozilla's Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix) instance. You can also file issues to this repo and/or suggest updates to the content with pull requests.

The purpose is to turn this feedback into tickets and improve the Firefox experience for users in your country.
