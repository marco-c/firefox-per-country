### Potential issues worth investigation
* > Some recent design breakage on mozilla web properties due to not taking into account locales  where words tend to be made up of more characters (german :)). maybe there can be more awareness for this issue or vetting when new sites/campaigns go live
a couple of filed github issues about this to be found here: https://www.camp-firefox.de/forum/thema/135595-mozilla-sucht-feedback-zum-deutschsprachigen-firefox/?postID=1213408#post1213408

### Feedback from our community
* > The German dictionary is bad and out of date.  There are actually three German dictionaries on AMO and they are all bad. There are common words missing, you get suggested compound words which make no sense instead of the correct ones and it doesn't keep up with current events like the pandemic which introduced new words into our language.
